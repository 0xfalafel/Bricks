# BRICKS

Bricks is a **deliberately vulnerable web application** to learn common vulnerabilites.

It features the following exercices:

* **SQL injection** authentication bypass.
* SQL injection content retrival with `UNION`.
* **File upload** vulnerabilities.


The interest of Bricks over some other training material is that:

1. It look nice
2. The **SQL query executed is reflected** in the webpage. Which make it **easier** to **understand SQL injections**.
